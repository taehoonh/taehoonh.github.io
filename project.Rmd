#### Rate Of General Anesthesia Use For Cesarean Delivery Among Anesthesiologists With And Without Fellowship Training in Obstetric Anesthesia

This report presents a retrospective statistical analysis of cesarean delivery among attending anesthesiologists with and without fellowship training in obstetric anesthesia who were seen at the NYP between 2009 and 2014 and had their rate of general anesthesia use assessed. Demographic, training / service experience, and outcomes of anesthesia were summarized. Logistic regression model was used to identify whether the fellowship-trained anesthesiologists are more or less likely to provide general anesthesia for non-routine c-section as compared to non-fellowship trained anesthesiologists.
