## *2019*

<br>

#### BRCA1/2 RNAseq study
- DE genes identification associated with type of BRCA mutation (BRCA2 vs. BRCA1) based on univariable analysis and maybe multivariable analyses later in the full cohort.
- DE genes identification in association with having invasive disease or not in the full cohort (n=130), BRCA1 cohort(n=70), and BRCA2 cohort (n=60)
- Univariable DEG analysis (CLSB, BMI.cat2, menopausal status) in subjects without invasive disease in the BRCA1/2 cohort (n=59), BRCA1 cohort (n=31), BRCA2 cohort (n=28)
- DE genes identification associated with type of BRCA mutation (BRCA2 vs. BRCA1) in subjects without invasive disease in the BRCA1/2 cohort (n=59)

#### Bayesian model averaging approach for RNA-seq counts data (BMA-seq) and its application

+ Develop a new statistical method using Bayesian model averaging to identify differentially expressed genes associated with one or more phenotypes, as well as their interactions.
+ Develop R package `BMAseq` using Bayesian model averaging to analyze observational gene-expression data
+ Apply the Bayesian model averaging method to large scale public RNA-seq gene expression data
+ Apply the Bayesian model averaging method (`BMA-seq`) to observational metabolomics data to improve differentially expressed (DE) metabolites identification in high dimensional setting

#### Liver transcriptome map of air pollution $PM_{2.5}$

+ Main interests: Gender and aging effect
+ Time point: Wk05 and Wk17
+ Gender: Male and Female
+ Groups: Chow FA, Chow PM, High fat diet FA, and High fat diet PM

<br>

#### Brain transcriptome map of air pollution $PM_{2.5}$

+ Construct data pipeline of both EdgeR and DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the exposure to ultra-fine dust, PM2.5
+ Check the distribution by Relative Log Expression (RLE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots
+ Normalize each sample and removed unwanted variances and filtered top 5,000 genes by p-values from EdgeR and DESeq2
+ Perform DE (Differential Expression) analysis using EdgeR and Gene Ontology (GO) Term analysis on six different brain sub-areas and liver cells.
+ Conduct pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software

#### Application of a Bayesian Model Averaging Method to Observational Metabolomics Data Analysis

+ Assist the advisor with developing a new statistical method using Bayesian model averaging to identify differentially expressed genes associated with one or more phenotypes, as well as their interactions.
+ Apply the Bayesian model averaging method (`BMA-seq`) to observational metabolomics data to improve differentially expressed (DE) metabolites identification in high dimensional setting

#### The Effect of Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) During the First 24 Hours on 30-day Mortality of Critically Ill Patients in Intensive Care Units

+ Applied data adaptation method to estimate the propensity score
+ Generated causal model estimands using multiple methods (random forest, GLM, elastic net, LASSO, and gradient boosting with SuperLearner)
+ Conducted 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate each estimand’s performance and coefficient in the ensemble estimator

#### Rate Of General Anesthesia Use For Cesarean Delivery Among Anesthesiologists With And Without Fellowship Training in Obstetric Anesthesia

+ Fitted the logistic regression model to identify whether the fellowship-trained anesthesiologists are more or less likely to provide general anesthesia for non-routine C-section as compared to non-fellowship trained anesthesiologists
+ Identified the significant difference between general and neuraxial anesthesia and the odds of using general anesthesia is 0.471 times lower in attending fellowship training anesthesiologists compared the non-fellowship training anesthesiologists

#### Cost-Effective Optimization of Model-Based Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)

+ Aimed to increase the accuracy of CVD diagnosis using a model-based approach
+ Determined the demographic factors and medical tests that help predict the likelihood of heart disease using proportional odds model and logistics regression
+ Identified a combination of necessary medical tests that help predict the probability of heart disease in a cost-effective manner and reduced the exam cost by $110.17
