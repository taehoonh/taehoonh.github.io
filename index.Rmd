I am a research assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) in the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.

I graduated from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/) with a Bachelor of Business Administration with an emphasis on Computer Science and [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) with a Master of Science in Quantitative Management: Business Analytics. In 2018, I began working toward my second MS degree in Biostatistics and Data Science at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/). 

I am currently working with [Xi Kathy Zhou, Ph.D., M.S.](http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/biostatistics/xi_kathy_zhou_profile.html) on a collaborative project with [Andrew J. Dannenberg, M.D.](https://research.cornell.edu/researchers/andrew-j-dannenberg) group that focuses on obesity, inflammation, the aromatase pathway, and their prognostic roles in cancer. Some other projects include the development of methodologies and R package using Bayesian Model Averaging in order to improve the methods when analyzing observational gene expression data.

Beyond the campus, I am also analyzing systematic effect of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ exposure on metabolism (Insulin Resistance), especially brain part, under the supervision of [Bongsoo Park, PhD](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3476/bongsoo-park) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Heatlh](https://www.jhsph.edu/).
