I am a Research Assistant in [Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology](https://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/research-collaboration/our-divisions/biostatistics) of Department of Healthcare Policy & Research at Weill Cornell Medicine. I graduated from [Weill Cornell Medical College](https://weill.cornell.edu/) with a MS in biostatistics and data science in 2019.

I am currently working with [Xi Kathy Zhou, PhD](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/xi-kathy-zhou) on a collaborative project with [Andrew J. Dannenberg, MD](https://research.cornell.edu/researchers/andrew-j-dannenberg) group that focuses on obesity → inflammation → the aromatase pathway, and their prognostic roles in cancer. 

Some other projects include developing a new statistical method using Bayesian model averaging to identify differentially expressed genes associated with one or more phenotypes, as well as their interactions. We are preparing for publication "*Bayesian model averaging approach for RNA-seq counts data (BMA-seq) and its application*."

Beyond the campus, I am also analyzing brain and liver transcriptome data to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the exposure to ultra-fine dust, PM2.5, under the supervision of [Bongsoo Park, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bongsoo-park-678b0416/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Heatlh](https://www.jhsph.edu/).
