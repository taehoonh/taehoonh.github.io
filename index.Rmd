I am a research assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.

I am graduating from [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) this December with a MS in biostatistics. Previously, I received BBA with an emphasis on quantitative methods from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/) in 2017 and MS in analytics from [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) in 2018.

I am currently working with [Xi Kathy Zhou, PhD](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/xi-kathy-zhou) on a collaborative project with [Andrew J. Dannenberg, MD](https://research.cornell.edu/researchers/andrew-j-dannenberg) group that focuses on obesity → inflammation → the aromatase pathway, and their prognostic roles in cancer. 

Some other projects include developing a new statistical method using Bayesian model averaging to identify differentially expressed genes associated with one or more phenotypes, as well as their interactions. We are preparing for publication "*Bayesian model averaging approach for RNA-seq counts data (BMA-seq) and its application*."

Beyond the campus, I am also analyzing brain and liver transcriptome data to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the exposure to ultra-fine dust, PM2.5, under the supervision of [Bongsoo Park, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bongsoo-park-678b0416/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Heatlh](https://www.jhsph.edu/).

My full CV is available [here](./files/TaehoonHa_CV_2019.pdf).

<strong>On-going Projects `(01/13/2020 updated)` </strong> <br>

- Re-analysis of the DXA study RNA-seq data
- Analysis of data related to serine MS
- Taiwan study (data preparation and analysis of the clinicopathologic data, CLS-B, adipocyte diameter, biomarker and body composition data)
- DE genes identification associated with type of BRCA mutation (BRCA2 vs. BRCA1) based on univariable analysis and maybe multivariable analyses later in the full cohort.
- DE genes identification in association with having invasive disease or not in the full cohort (n=130), BRCA1 cohort(n=70), and BRCA2 cohort (n=60)
- Univariable DEG analysis (CLSB, BMI.cat2, menopausal status) in subjects without invasive disease in the BRCA1/2 cohort (n=59), BRCA1 cohort (n=31), BRCA2 cohort (n=28)
- DE genes identification associated with type of BRCA mutation (BRCA2 vs. BRCA1) in subjects without invasive disease in the BRCA1/2 cohort (n=59)
- Predicting aromatase levels using blood biomarker data
- Bayesian model averaging approach for RNA-seq counts data (**BMA-seq**) and its application
- R package development for **BMA-Seq** to improve the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes in high dimensional setting
- Transcriptome and epigenome atlas for air pollution $\text{PM}_{2.5}$: Brain and Liver
- Relationship between human blood pressure, urine sodium intake and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB)
