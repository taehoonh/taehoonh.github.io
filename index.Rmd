My interest is in developing and applying novel statistical methods to better design biological and clinical studies. I recently jointed the [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/research/cancer/animal-facility/) as a biostatistician. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine in the [Department of Population Health Sciences](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/research-collaboration/our-divisions/biostatistics), where I worked primarily in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, obesity, and inflammation.

I graduated from [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) with a MS in biostatistics and data science in 2019.

Beyond the lab, I am also analyzing brain and liver transcriptome data to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the exposure to ultra-fine dust, PM2.5, under the supervision of [Bongsoo Park, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bongsoo-park-678b0416/) at National Insitute of Health and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Heatlh.

My full CV is available [here](./files/TaehoonHa_CV_202006.pdf).
