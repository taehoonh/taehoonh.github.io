My interest is in developing and applying novel statistical methods to better design biological and clinical studies. 

Currently, I work as a biostatistician at [Stony Brook Medicine](https://osa.stonybrookmedicine.edu/research-core-facilities/bcc), where I collaborate extensively with researchers across various disciplines, including clinical, translational, and laboratory-based studies. My work spans multiple departments and specialties, providing statistical expertise to improve research design, data analysis, and scientific outcomes.

Previously, I worked as a biostatistician at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu), where I was in charge of the Biostatistics Core, effectively serving as its director. In this role, I led statistical efforts for groundbreaking research in cancer biology, neuroscience, and genomics, overseeing experimental design, data analysis, and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams. Before this, I was a research assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weillcornell.org) in the Department of Population Health Sciences, where I focused on breast cancer, colorectal cancer, obesity, and inflammation research. At both institutions, I developed expertise in managing large-scale health data, integrating advanced statistical methodologies, and mentoring researchers to address complex biological and clinical questions.

I graduated from [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) with an MS in biostatistics and data science. My resume is available [here](files/Resume_TaehoonHa_202408.pdf).
