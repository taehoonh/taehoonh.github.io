I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to obesity and breast cancer through my work as a Research Assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/). 

I graduated from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/) with a Bachelor of Business Administration with an emphasis on Computer Science and [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) with a Master of Science in Quantitative Management and Analytics. In 2018, I began working toward my second MS degree in Biostatistics and Data Science at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/), where I am investigating statistical methods for complex biological data including RNA-seq gene expression, microbiome, and other types of high throughput biological data from observational studies and designed experiments under the advisement of [Xi Kathy Zhou, Ph.D., M.S.](http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/biostatistics/xi_kathy_zhou_profile.html) at Weill Cornell Medicine in the department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. 

I am also working on analyzing systematic effect of $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ exposure on metabolism (Insulin Resistance), especially brain part, under the supervision of [Bongsoo Park, PhD](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3476/bongsoo-park) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhsph.edu/). I expect to graduate by the end of 2019.
