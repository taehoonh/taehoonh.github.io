My interest is in developing and applying novel statistical methods to better design biological and clinical studies. Currently, I am working as a biostatistican at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/research/cancer/animal-facility/). I collaborate extensively with a focus on cancer related laboratory and clinical studies.

Previously, I worked as a research assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine in the Department of Population Health Sciences](https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/research-collaboration/our-divisions/biostatistics), where I worked primarily in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, obesity, and inflammation.

I graduated from [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) with a MS in biostatistics and data science in 2019.

Beyond the lab, I am also analyzing brain and liver transcriptome data to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the exposure to ultra-fine dust, PM2.5, under the supervision of [Bongsoo Park, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bongsoo-park-678b0416/) at National Insitute of Health and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Heatlh.

My full CV is available [here](files/TaehoonHa_Biosketch_202012.pdf).

<strong>* Office Hour (Thursday 2-4 pm)</strong> <br>

My office hour is a Cancer Center sponsored core resource whose goal is to provide for, enhance, and/or facilitate statistical collaboration involving the design, conduct, analysis, or publication of biomedical research at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cancer Center. This is complimentary statistical advice only for the CSHL Cancer Center faculty, staff, and students.

If you have additional questions, please feel free to reach out via ha@cshl.edu. Thank you.
