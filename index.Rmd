I am a research assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research.

I am graduating from [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) this December with a M.S. in biostatistics. Previously, I received B.B.A with an emphasis on Quantitative Methods from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/) in 2017 and M.S in Business Analytics from [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). 

I am currently working with [Xi Kathy Zhou, PhD](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/faculty/xi-kathy-zhou) on a collaborative project with [Andrew J. Dannenberg, MD](https://research.cornell.edu/researchers/andrew-j-dannenberg) group that focuses on obesity → inflammation → the aromatase pathway, and their prognostic roles in cancer. 

Some other projects include developing a new statistical method using Bayesian model averaging to identify differentially expressed genes associated with one or more phenotypes, as well as their interactions. We are preparing for publication "*Bayesian model averaging approach for RNA-seq counts data (BMA-seq) and its application*."

Beyond the campus, I am also analyzing the brain data to identify differentially expressed genes associated with the exposure to ultra-fine dust, PM2.5, under the supervision of [Bongsoo Park, PhD](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3476/bongsoo-park) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Heatlh](https://www.jhsph.edu/).

My full CV is available [here](./files/TaehoonHa_CV_2019.pdf).
