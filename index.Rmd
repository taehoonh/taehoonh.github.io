I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to breast cancer through my work as a Research Assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/). 

I graduated from the [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/) with a Bachelor of Business Administration with an emphasis on Computer Science and [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) with a Master of Science in Quantitative Management and Analytics. In 2018, I began working toward my second MS degree in Biostatistics and Data Science at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/), where I am investigating statistical methods for complex biological data including RNA-seq gene expression, microbiome, and other types of high throughput biological data from observational studies and designed experiments under the advisement of [Dr. Xi Kathy Zhou](http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/biostatistics/xi_kathy_zhou_profile.html) at Weill Cornell Medicine. I expect to graduate by the end of 2019.

My full CV is available [here](files/cv.pdf).
